# My dotfiles

## Why?
Allows me to update all dotfiles when changes are made easily. All my dotfiles
are under the 'myDotFiles' folder.

## LinkDots
This program automatically makes soft links in the right place for each dotfile.
This is done by keeping the correct file heirachy in 'myDotFiles' folder, with
everything in that folder put into ~/

running linkDots -f will remove all conflicting files and replace them with soft 
links to those in the git repo
