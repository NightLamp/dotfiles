# My dotfiles
these are my dotfiles.

You can run lndotfiles.sh to automatically create soft links in the right
places, making setup easier. Note that there are no checks for permissions.

## Setup
setup.sh can be used to set up a new machine. It will install programs that I expect to use and to set the machine into a working state

Note that these are primarily for Ubuntu, and running setup.sh will not work outside of Ubuntu. lndotfiles.sh should work on all Unix based systems.
